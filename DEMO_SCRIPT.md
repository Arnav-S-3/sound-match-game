# Demo Script for Sound Match! Game
*Duration: 2-3 minutes*

## Opening (15 seconds)
"Hi! I'm excited to show you Sound Match - an accessible audio-first memory game designed specifically for children with visual impairments, but fun for everyone to play."

## Problem & Solution (30 seconds)
"Most digital games rely heavily on visuals, excluding children who are blind or have low vision. Sound Match solves this by creating a completely audio-based memory game where players find matching pairs of sounds using only keyboard navigation and audio feedback."

## Live Demo (90 seconds)

### Game Setup
"Let me show you how it works. The game has 6 tiles arranged in a 3x2 grid, containing 3 pairs of matching sounds."

*[Navigate to the game, press H for help]*
"I can press H to hear the instructions..."

### Navigation Demo
"I use arrow keys to move between tiles - you can hear the focus moving."
*[Demonstrate arrow key navigation]*

### Gameplay Demo
"When I press Enter or Space, the tile plays its unique sound..."
*[Select tile 1, let sound play, wait for speech announcement]*
"Notice how the game first plays the sound, then after a brief pause, announces the tile position."

*[Select another tile]*
"Let me try to find a match..."
*[Demonstrate both matching and non-matching attempts]*

### Accessibility Features
"The game includes several accessibility features:
- Full keyboard navigation
- Screen reader compatibility  
- Speech synthesis announcements
- High contrast visual indicators for low vision users
- Audio-first design with no visual dependencies"

## Impact & Innovation (30 seconds)
"What makes this special is that it's designed for accessibility from the ground up, not as an afterthought. By creating an audio-first experience, we've made a game that's not only accessible to children with visual impairments, but also introduces sighted players to a new way of gaming."

## Closing (15 seconds)
"Sound Match demonstrates that inclusive design creates better experiences for everyone. The game is live at [URL] and the code is available on GitHub. Thank you!"
